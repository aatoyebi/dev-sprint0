Explain what each of the following lines does. Use the terminology you learned from the book (or Google)
	
	from TurtleWorld import *
	world = TurtleWorld()
	bob = Turtle()
	wait_for_user()

Answer: Imports TurtleWorld module and all functions
Places TurtleWorld function in variable called world
Places Turtle function in variable called bob
Calls wait_for_user() function, which waits for user action


These questions pertain to the program you wrote in Week0.

-- What are the arguments of polygon()?  What type is each argument?
Answer: turtle, length, n
turtle is name of the turtle
length is the length of each side
n is the number of sides


-- What two turtle functions did you use to draw the sides of the polygon?
Answer: fd(t, length)
		lt(t, angle)

-- What are the arguments for polyline?  What type is each argument?
Answer: t, n, length, angle
t is the name of the turtle
n is the number of sides
length is the length of a side
angle is the angle of each side



Suppose you wrote a function, center_circle(), that draws a circle of a given radius around the current location of the turtle and restores the turtle to its starting point.

-- What turtle functions would you use to move the turtle from the center to the edge of the circle and get ready to call the original circle() function?
Answer: pu(bob)
		fd(bob, r)
		lt(bob)
		pd(bob)

-- Suppose the interface of this function requires the turtle to end up in the same place it started, facing in the same direction it started.
Answer: pu(bob)
		rt(bob)
		bk(bob, r)

-- What is this type of requirement called?
Answer: postcondition
